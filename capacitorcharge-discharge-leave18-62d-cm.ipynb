    "The circuit diagaram as shown was made. The capacitor was charged until the reading on the voltmeter did not increase. The capacitor was discharged. The voltage was measured for one minute at 10 second intervals. Once the voltage through the capacitor was circa 0, the capacitor was charged. The voltage was measured for one minute at 10 second intervals.  \n",

    "One hazard that was identified was that the resistor may heat up when the circuit is complete, hence touching the resistor when the circuit is complete is not recommended\n",
